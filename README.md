A tool to save the positions and rotations of tracked devices in SteamVR to an FBX file. Could be useful e.g. for adjusting avatar proportions for full-body tracking in platforms like VRChat.

Features:

- Optional countdown, letting you get into the right pose before saving
- Choose which devices to include/exclude from saving
- Help text
- Easter egg for a friend :)
